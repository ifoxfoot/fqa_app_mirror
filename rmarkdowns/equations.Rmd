## Non Cover-Weighted Equations

In this set of equations, species $i$ has been assigned a coefficient of conservatism $C_{i}$ and a wetness coefficient $W_{i}$.

#### Species Richness

The total number of unique species in the site assessment.

$$
N_{t}
$$

#### Native Species Richness

The total number of unique native species in the site assessment.

$$
N_{n}
$$

#### Mean Wetness

The mean wetness coefficient for all species in the site assessment. The wetness coefficient is based on USFWS Wetland Indicator Status. Negative wetness coefficients indicate a stronger affinity for wetlands, while positive wetland coefficients indicate an affinity for upland.

$$
\overline{W_{t}} = \sum_{i=0}^{t} W_{i}\bigg/N_{t}
$$

#### Native Mean Wetness

The mean wetness coefficient for native species in the site assessment. 

$$
\overline{W_{n}} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} W_{i}\bigg/N_{n}
$$

#### Mean C

The mean coefficient of conservatism of all species in the site assessment.

$$
\overline{C_{t}} = \sum_{i=0}^{t} C_{i} \bigg/ N_{t}
$$

#### Native Mean C

The mean coefficient of conservatism of native species in the site assessment.

$$
\overline{C_{n}} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} C_{i}\bigg/N_{n}
$$

#### FQI

Mean C multiplied by the square root of Species Richness.

$$
I_{t} = \overline{C_{t}} \sqrt{N_{t}}
$$

#### Native FQI

Native Mean C multiplied by the square root of Native Species Richness.

$$
I_{n} = \overline{C_{n}} \sqrt{N_{n}}
$$

#### Adjusted FQI

100 multiplied by the Native Mean C over 10, multiplied by the square root of Native Species Richness over Total Species Richness.

$$
I' = 100\bigg(\frac{\overline{C_{n}}}{10}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{\sqrt{N_{n}}}{\sqrt{N_{t}}}\bigg)
$$

## Cover-Weighted Equations

In this set of equations, species $i$ has been assigned a coefficient of conservatism $C_{i}$. Species $i$ also has a percent cover $\gamma_i$.

#### Plot-Level Cover-Weighted Mean C

The sum of percent cover multiplied by the C value per each species, divided by the sum of cover values for all species.

$$
\overline{C_{t\gamma}} = \sum_{i=0}^{t} C_{i}\gamma_{i} \bigg/ \sum_{i=0}^{t}\gamma_{i}
$$

#### Plot-Level Native Cover-Weighted Mean C

The sum of percent cover multiplied by the C value per each native species, divided by the sum of cover values for all native species.

$$
\overline{C_{n\gamma}} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} C_{i}\gamma_{i} \bigg/ \sum_{i=0}^{n}\gamma_{i}
$$

#### Transect-Level Cover-Weighted Mean C

The sum of each species' C value multiplied by the species' mean cover and divided by the sum of each species' mean cover. 

$$
\overline{C_{t\gamma}} = \sum_{i=0}^{t} C_{i}\overline{\gamma_{i}} \bigg/ \sum_{i=0}^{t}\overline{\gamma_{i}}
$$

#### Transect-Level Native Cover-Weighted Mean C

The sum of each native species' C value multiplied by the species' mean cover and divided by the sum of each native species' mean cover. 

$$
\overline{C_{n\gamma}} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} C_{i}\overline{\gamma_{i}} \bigg/ \sum_{i=0}^{n}\overline{\gamma_{i}}
$$

#### Cover-Weighted FQI

Cover-Weighted Mean C multiplied by the square root of Species Richness.

$$
I_{t\gamma} = \overline{C_{t\gamma}}\sqrt{N_{t}}
$$

#### Native Cover-Weighted FQI

Cover-Weighted Native Mean C multiplied by the square root of Native Species Richness.

$$
I_{n\gamma} = \overline{C_{n\gamma}}\sqrt{N_{n}}
$$

#### Relative Frequency

The frequency of a species, family, or physiognomic group multiplied by 100 and then multiplied by the frequency of all species, families, or physiognomic groups. 

$$
\mu_{r} = \bigg(\mu_{i}\bigg/\sum_{i =0}^{t}\mu_{i}\bigg)
$$

#### Relative Coverage

The total cover per group of interest (species, taxonomic family, or physiognomic group) multiplied by 100 and divided by the total cover for all observations.

$$
\mu_{r} = \bigg(\gamma_{i}\bigg/\sum_{i =0}^{t}\gamma_{i}\bigg)
$$

#### Relative Importance

Relative Frequency added to Relative Coverage, over two.

$$
RIV = \bigg(\mu_{r} + \gamma_{r}\bigg)\bigg/2
$$
