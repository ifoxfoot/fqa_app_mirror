<h2>Floristic Quality Assessments</h2>
<p>Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) provides a standardized way to
rapidly assess the integrity of an area based on the botanic species
that are present. FQA works by assigning each plant a score from 0 to
10. This score is called a Conservation Coefficient, or C Score. Scores
of 0 indicate plants that are invasive or prefer highly disturbed
habitat, while higher scores represent higher fidelity to undisturbed
habitat. Because plants may exhibit different levels of fidelity to
intact habitat in different regions, expert botanists have convened to
produce regional FQA lists.</p>
<p>By referencing regional FQA lists, local land managers can quickly
assess areas by tallying species that are present in their area of
interest and then calculating floristic quality metrics based on their
assigned C scores.</p>
<p>Common floristic quality metrics include mean C (the mean of C values
for all species present) and FQI (the mean c multiplied by the square
root of the total number of species.</p>

<p>There are 48 regional FQA lists that are currently fully approved or
approved with reservations for use by the US Army Core of Engineers.</p>
