## Floristic Quality Assessment Index

Floristic Quality Assessment Index (FQA) provides a standardized way to rapidly assess the condition of a vegetated area based on the plant species that are present. FQA works by assigning each plant species a value from 0 to 10. This value is called a Coefficient of Conservatism or C Value. Values of 0 indicates species that are highly tolerant of human activities and have general environmental needs, while higher values represent higher fidelity to a specific habitat and less tolerance to anthropogenic disturbances. Generally, C values are assigned by a group of expert regional botanists, resulting in numerous regional FQA lists of flora and their associated C Values covering various geographic areas, such as states, biomes or geologic features.

## FQA Databases

As of 2022, regional FQAs have been reviewed, and those deemed sufficient, recommended for planning model certification by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center’s Environmental Laboratory in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Center of Ecosystem Restoration Expertise. Certified Regional FQAs have been compiled and available for rapid and consistent calculation of FQA metrics within this web application.

Common floristic quality metrics include Mean C (the mean of C Values for all species present in an inventory or along a transect) and the Floristic Quality Assessment Index (FQAI, the Mean C multiplied by the square root of the total number of species).

There are 51 regional FQAs that are currently certified or approved with reservations for use by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in their planning process.
