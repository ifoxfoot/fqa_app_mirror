## Floristic Quality Assessments

Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) provides a standardized way to rapidly assess the integrity of an area based on the botanic species that are present. FQA works by assigning each plant a value from 0 to 10. This value is called a Coefficient of Conservatism, or C Value. Values of 0 indicate plants that are invasive or prefer highly disturbed habitat, while higher values represent higher fidelity to undisturbed habitat. Because plants may exhibit different levels of fidelity to intact habitat in different regions, expert botanists have convened to produce regional FQA lists.

By referencing regional FQA lists, local land managers can quickly calculate floristic quality metrics.

Common floristic quality metrics include mean C (the mean of C values for all species present) and FQI (the mean C multiplied by the square root of the total number of species).

## FQA Databases

There are 51 regional FQA lists that are currently fully approved or approved with reservations for use by the US Army Corps of Engineers.

Take a look at what regional lists might be applicable in your area:
